# Object-Oriented Programming Ex_2

## Description
This is the third task in Object-Oriented Programming course (OOP).

In this task, we added to our UndoableStringBuilder class an option to organize a group of update recipients to send users all the updates in real time.
We used S.O.L.I.D principles 

During the semester, we learned that Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
allows a Java application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.
The Thread class supports the creation of platform threads that are typically mapped 1:1 to kernel threads, scheduled
by the operating system.


For this program we added Test class for checking the reliability and the efficiency of the code.
